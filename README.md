# Brie-OL7
I’m working with a core group of open thinkers within my organisation to promote open work through a combination of advocacy and modelling open leadership, so that our colleagues across the whole organisation can see the benefits and begin to figure out how to bring openness into their own work.

I believe that greater openness in our work will improve our relationships with partners, make the tools and solutions we build more relevant, and bring us closer into alignment with the Principles for Digital Development (agreed best-practice principles for applying digital tools in a development context). Treating this culture change journey itself as an open project and applying open leadership principles to it is useful both for us to gain experience working in the open, and for our colleagues to see what it looks like in practice. More fundamentally, however, since this project is about doing a better job of translating values into practice, the only way to get there is by living those values - we can only reach increased openness through increased openness!

I’ve set two personal goals - one to address a weakness (I need to make a point of creating time for communication and information sharing, rather than letting it slip through the cracks when I get busy), and one to get the ball rolling on setting up an open project within my organisation. I’ve  also set two organisational goals - one to assemble a core group of evangelists to work with me on this, and one to develop good systems and processes for open working within my team.
